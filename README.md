## Technical Details:

#### This project was made with : <br />
* Unity 2019.4.16f1 <br />
* FireBase App , Authentification , RealTime DataBase (Package 8.3.0) <br />
* facebook-unity-sdk-11.0.0 <br />

You need to make your own realTime Database and setup firebase and facebook sdks on your own 
## Limitations:
this is not a full game in anyway , this is just a small demo I made as a sample of my code . <br/><br/>
There is lot of features that needs to be added like : <br/>

* Queue system and matchmaking (google requires non prepaid credit card to use google cloud functions which is something I do not have RN)<br/>
* friend and social system<br/>
* Time To give certain time for players to play <br/>
* Notify Players when opponent leaves the match and end the game <br/>
* etc...<br/>
